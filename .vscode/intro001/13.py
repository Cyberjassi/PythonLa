# Welcome back to another coding exercise solutionI hope it went well!

# This is my solution to the coding exercise. Again, it may be slightly different from yours!

# # First, as the user for their name. Then, print out the greeting "Hello, NAME"
# # Remember the uppercase H, the comma, and the space between words!
# user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
# print(f"Hello, {user_name}")

# # Secondly, ask the user for their age and convert it into a number.
# # Then, print out how many months that equals to (you'll have to multiply the age by 12).
# user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# print(user_age * 12)
# Let me know how you got on!

# Kind regards,

# Jose and the Teclado team
name = input("what is your name")
print(f"Hello, {name}")
age = int(input("how old are you"))
print(f"Your age month {12*age}")
