# Congratulations on completing your first coding exercise!

# The purpose of these exercises is to help you practice and write some code,getinstant feedback, and be able to ask questions about it!

# If you have any questions about anything in the code exercises, please ask in the Course Q&A and we'll be very happy to help you.

# This is my solution to the coding exercisewhich may be slightly different from yours:

# # Create two variables, var1 and var2, both with the same value.
# var1 = 2
# var2 = 2

# # Create two variables, num1 and num2, which multiply together to give 16.
# num1 = 4
# num2 = 4
# Let me know how you got on!

# Kind regards,

# Jose and the Teclado team

# P.S.Coding exercises require careful reading of instructions, because they are designed to pass ONLY if your code meets the criteria exactly as set out in the exercise. Again, ask in the Course Q&A if you have any doubts!
